# RootFinding_ShinyApp
A shiny app made using RStudio that illustrates different methods of finding roots to one-dimensional functions.

The three .R files in this repository (bisection, newtonraphson, and fixedpoint) are scripts that are used by the app code to calculate function roots.
TO RUN THE APP: 
simply open the Rmd file in RStudio. Then run the block of code that initializes the functions we will use. Then run the app code underneath it.
